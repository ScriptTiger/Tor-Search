# Tor-Search
Quickly and easily search Tor exit nodes based on geodata securely and anonymously offline and instantly build node lists.

**This script requires the Geo Tor Table to be present in the same directory to function properly. Visit the following URL for more information and to download the latest:

Where allowed, you may input multiple items of a single type to search for by simply separating each with a space. For example, if inputting an IP address to search for, entering `8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4` would search for both 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4. Another example would be if searching for exit nodes in both the US state of California and New York, you could enter `CA NY`. However, please note, when searching smaller subdivisions, like states, cities, provinces, etc., it is recommended you also enter criteria for the larger regions of which they are a member, such as their continent, country, etc., as some subdivisions in some countries may have conflicting codes with subdivisions in other countries.

Some search criteria for this script are ISO codes, which are standardized codes managed by the International Organization for Standardization and are universal, independent of language. Some other search criteria are GeoNames IDs, managed by the GeoNames database and are also universal and independent of language. Please refer to the respective authorities, or simply use your favorite Web search engine, to quickly look up code/ID references.
